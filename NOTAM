Scheduled Quarterly Maintenance
Hi, All.

I will be performing quarterly server maintenance on Friday the 19th of June at 1400UTC, which should only take around 15 minutes. I do not expect there to be any downtime during the maintenance window. As always, if things change, I will be updating the status page accordingly. You may like to check it often for potential updates, which can be done at status.ziboupdater.net

Many thanks!
