Hi all!

I have received a number of questions recently regarding the lack of availability of the 3.40 public beta through the Updater.

After speaking with Lubos (Zibo), I've decided that it will be best to wait until 3.40 is completely ready, and some of the issues* with it are ironed out. Once 3.40 is out of beta, you will be notified of its availability as normal.

Please note however, that you may still upgrade to 3.40 via the Updater manually, though you will not receive notifications about updates for the 3.40 public beta branch.

If there is enough demand to roll out the 3.40 beta to everybody, I will do so, and remove 3.39 from the server. At this time, I will keep things as they are, with 3.39 being the latest release offered by the ZIBO Updater.

Thanks, and I hope that clears some things up for all of you,
Slavbass.
