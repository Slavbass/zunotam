3.41 Public Beta
Hi, All.

If you wish to try the 3.41 Public Beta for the B738X, ensure that you have 3.40.27 installed first.

Furthermore, before updating to 3.41, delete your plugins folder before commencing the update.

The public beta currently has a few issues, and has therefore been made optional and not available via the updater. You may download the beta releases via the Google Drive. 

Cheers,
Slavbass
