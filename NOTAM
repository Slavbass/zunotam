3.41 Public Betas
Hi, All.

Please be aware that due to the unstable nature of public betas for the B737-800X, the ZIBO Updater will not offer them to you.

You need to download the beta files yourself from the Google Drive, and follow the installation instructions packaged with them (if applicable).

You may still use the ZIBO Updater to install the files manually, if you wish. While these betas are not officially supported, they will still work when installing them using the software.

Remember to use Restore Points in case something goes wrong, so that you may revert your installation back to a working state.

Thanks!
