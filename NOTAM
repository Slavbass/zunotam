Scheduled Maintenance
Hi all,

As always, the 15th of every month is server maintenance day. This month's maintenance falls on 2000UTC, Tuesday the 15th of September.

You can keep up to date with the latest information regarding maintenance on http://status.ziboupdater.net

Maintenance will mostly be done 'live', meaning that downtime will be absolutely minimal (2-3 minutes at most) - with that in mind, the maintenance window will last one hour in order to accommodate any issues that may occur.
