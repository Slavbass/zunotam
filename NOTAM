Network Maintenance - Pushed Back
Hi All,

The 15th of every month is usually a maintenance day, however this has had to be pushed back until tomorrow (OCT 16TH) at 2100UTC.

Downtime of around 10-15 is expected during this maintenance period, so your patience is appreciated.

Many thanks in advance
Slavbass
