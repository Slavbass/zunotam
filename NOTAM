Network issue has escalated. Neighbouring country also affected by massive service outages since 1600UTC.

No other information is known at this time. I will keep you updated as the situation develops, or if provider posts an update. For now, expect intermittent connection to ZIBO Update server. Advise holding off using the online update feature until situation is resolved.
Thanks.
