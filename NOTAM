Hi,

There seems to be a network issue affecting my provider, resulting slower than usual upstream from the server and in some cases, complete connection dropouts.

I am assured that the issue is being worked on in order to resume normal service ASAP.

Thanks for you understanding, and my apologies if you experience any interruptions while using the Updater.
Cheers,
Slavbass.
