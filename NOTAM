Server Maintenance
Hi all,

It's time for monthly server maintenance, which will take place today (2nd of May, 2020) at 2100UTC until approximately 2115UTC.

This means that ZIBO Updater will not be able to contact the server during this time, and any network errors can be safely ignored.

Thanks for your understanding,
Slavbass
