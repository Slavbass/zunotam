API Issue
Hi All,

An issue with the ZIBO Updater API has been detected, resulting in delayed synchronisation of B737-800X updates. The issue is being worked on, and fix will be deployed in the coming week.

Until the issue is fully resolved, expect a delay in receiving update notifications for the 800X.

Check out status.ziboupdater.net for updates.

Many thanks for your patience.
