Hi,

If you are affected by the following issue in B737-800X V3.40 and V3.40.2/V3.40.2A:
- EFB Reads 3.40RC5 as the aircraft version/not what you currently have installed.

Please navigate to the B737-800X\plugins\xlua\scripts directory, and delete the following folders:
- B738.aaa_fms
- B738.AXP_1_EQ_commands
- B738.AXP_2_flightcontrol_commands
- B738.AXP_3_FMOD_commands
- B738.AXP_4_FMOD_logic

If your EFB is showing "Detected missing or unsupported files", please re-install 3.40, and update to the latest patch once again.

Thanks.
